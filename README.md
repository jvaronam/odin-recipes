# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website built with HTML.
I have done three pages with recipes for Lasagna Bolognese, Spanish Tortilla and Paella Valenciana.
Each page has an image of the finished dish, a description, ingredients and steps.
The goal is to practice structuring content and linking multiple pages.
